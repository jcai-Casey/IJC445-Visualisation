# IJC445-Visualisation
This project explores how PM2.5 concentrations in Sheffield vary over time and how they relate to meteorological conditions such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
Using a set of four visualisations, the analysis aims to build an intuitive understanding of pollution patterns, with a focus on seasonal, diurnal, and high-pollution events.
