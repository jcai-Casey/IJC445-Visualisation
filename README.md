# IJC445-Visualisation
The project analyzes the change in PM2.5 concentration in Sheffield from 2023 to 2024, especially its relationship with weather (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
These four pictures tell us that high pollution in Sheffield does not occur randomly. PM2.5 concentration levels tend to increase in the evening, and high-pollution events are often associated with high humidity and low wind speeds.
